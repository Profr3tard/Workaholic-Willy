"""The perception stack as a value: the seven fields that decide it, resolved before a weight loads.

``build_perception`` is the only function that reads ``models.pipeline``. ``build_object_detector``
and ``build_segmenter``, which ``build_real_components`` calls, read only ``models.detector`` and
``models.segmenter_backend`` (``factory.py:27-61``), so a stack assembled from that pair ignores the
pipeline block with no error and no log line, and ``build_perception``'s fail-closed refusals never
fire for it.

:meth:`PerceptionSpec.build` hands itself to ``build_perception``, so there is one builder. The
spec's seven fields are exactly the seven attributes that function reads, which is why it satisfies
the same structural contract a ``ModelsConfig`` does and why the factory annotates its input as
:class:`PerceptionFields` rather than ``ModelsConfig``.

Seven and not the ten a ``ModelsConfig`` carries: three of those ten are required and one of the
three is ``stt``, eleven Whisper fields with ten mandatory that perception never reads. ``stt`` is
not defaulted, and defaulting it would change validation for every YAML tree in the repository, so
the spec carries seven fields and a Python caller never has to supply ``stt`` at all.

Importing this module must not pull torch, because ``autonomous_grasp`` imports it. Every heavy
import stays inside ``build()``, as ``factory.py`` already does.
