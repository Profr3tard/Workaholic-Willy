"""Find the MediaPipe `.task` bundle, or refuse with something an operator can act on.

MediaPipe is an optional extra and its model files are not in this repository; the operator installs
both. Left to the libraries, either absence reports poorly:

* mediapipe missing raises `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mediapipe'` at import time, from a
  module the caller never imported by name;
* the `.task` file missing raises from inside MediaPipe's C++ graph, naming neither the config key
  that supplied the path nor where the file comes from.

Both are therefore checked here, up front, and the message names the config key, the resolved
absolute path and the download URL. The check is fail-closed: a missing hand reads exactly like an
absent hand, so a detector that silently does not run is worse than one that refuses to start.
