"""Thumbs up / thumbs down, from MediaPipe's canned gesture classifier.

The canned model is used instead of our own geometry because a thumbs-up is easy to describe and
hard to detect: "thumb extended along the hand's up-axis, other fingers curled" also fits a hand
holding a pen, a fist seen at an angle, and a thumb pointing at the camera. The canned classifier
was trained on people actually doing it.

What this package promises is narrower than what the classifier knows. It reports seven shapes; two
of them are mapped and everything else goes in `OTHER`, keeping the raw label. Narrowing the
contract here rather than at each call site means a caller cannot accidentally start depending on
`Pointing_Up` without editing this file and reading why it was excluded.

The label spelling is not assumed. MediaPipe documents the categories as `Thumb_Up` / `Thumb_Down`,
but this maps on a normalised form (case-folded, separators stripped), so `Thumb_Up`, `thumb up` and
`ThumbUp` all land on the same value. The exact spelling of the bundled model has not been verified
here, because the `.task` files are an operator download and are not present, so the normalisation
is doing real work.
