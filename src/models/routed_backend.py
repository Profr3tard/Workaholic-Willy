"""Two perception backends behind one, chosen per prompt by a router.

    backend = RoutedPerceptionBackend(router=..., simple_factory=..., vlm_factory=...)
    objects = backend.perceive(image_bgr, "der kaputte Würfel")   # -> the VLM route
    backend.last_decision.describe()                              # 'vlm (non_english)'

Both routes are lazy. Building both eagerly would load GroundingDINO and Qwen at cell build, around
nine gigabytes of VRAM and ten seconds, on a cell that may only ever send simple prompts, or only
complex ones. Each route is built the first time it is chosen.

The simple route gets a normalised prompt; the VLM route does not. GroundingDINO's caption
convention, lowercase with one trailing period, is what its text encoder was trained on, while the
VLM is asked to reason about the operator's phrasing, so rewriting that would change the question.

The decision is recorded, not just acted on. ``last_decision`` and the ``on_decision`` callback are
what the console, the PERCEIVED event and ``GraspAttemptRecord.extra`` read, so an operator seeing a
slow pick can find out that their wording chose the expensive route, and which word did it.
