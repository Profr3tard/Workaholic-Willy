"""Turn a vision-language model's free-form answer into validated :class:`Detection` boxes.

The half of the VLM route that runs without a GPU. A grounding VLM returns text, not a tensor, and
that text may be prose, a markdown fence, an apology, malformed JSON, or well-formed JSON that still
describes a nonsensical box.

The contract parsed here is Qwen's grounding format,

    [{"bbox_2d": [x0, y0, x1, y1], "label": "red cube"}, ...]

in whichever coordinate space the model was trained to emit. That space is an explicit parameter
(:class:`CoordinateSpace`) and never a guess, because guessing it wrong is silent: on a 1280x720
frame, 0-1000 grid values are in range, ordered, sane-sized, and pass every validation below, so
nothing fails and the gripper simply goes to the wrong place, which is what this route exists to
prevent.

`Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct` emits a 0-1000 normalised grid, not pixels. Asked to ground objects in a
1280x720 frame it returns coordinates of ``999`` and ``1000``, which cannot be pixels of a
720-pixel-tall image; and on a 640x480 frame with a square at ``(100, 100, 200, 200)`` it answers
``(144, 198, 312, 418)``, where that square on a 0-1000 grid is ``(156, 208, 312, 417)``.

Every rejection below is a box that would otherwise become a grasp pose, and a mangled box does not
throw; it moves the gripper somewhere wrong. So the parser drops rather than repairs whenever repair
would mean guessing:

* Coordinates outside the declared space are not reinterpreted. Under
  :attr:`CoordinateSpace.ABSOLUTE`, a value like ``0.1`` clamps to a sub-pixel box and is dropped;
  reading it as a fraction instead would be the same guess, made per box.
* Inverted corners are repaired by swapping, because ``x1 < x0`` has exactly one possible intent.
* Out-of-image boxes are clamped, then re-checked for degeneracy, so a box entirely off-frame
  collapses and is dropped.

A grounding VLM emits no calibrated score. :data:`VLM_NOMINAL_SCORE` means "the model asserted
this", not "the model is this sure", and the model's own output order is preserved as its ranking.
Nothing downstream should read it as a probability.
