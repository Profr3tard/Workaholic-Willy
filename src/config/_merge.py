"""Recursive mapping-merge used by the config loader.

Contract: a ``None`` overlay leaf keeps the base value, so a partial overlay can omit by null
without wiping fields. A profile overlay that must reset a base field to ``None`` writes the reset
sentinel defined in ``src/config/loader.py`` instead, so a reset never reaches this merge as
``None``.

``src.robot.grasping.replay.presets`` keeps a separate ``_deep_merge`` on purpose and is not folded
in here: its None/Mapping/deepcopy semantics are a different contract, and it does not keep the base
value on a ``None`` overlay leaf.
