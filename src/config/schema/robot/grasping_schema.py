    runtime carrier in :mod:`src.robot.grasping.uncertainty`). When
    :attr:`enabled`, :attr:`fail_closed_threshold` replaces
    :attr:`GraspingDecisionConfig.auto_uncertainty_threshold`; when disabled the
    legacy decision threshold remains (byte-identical). The layer always emits a
    typed snapshot on every :class:`AutonomousGraspReport` (``fused=0.0,
    fused_available=False`` when disabled). ``"easy"`` is excluded from
    :attr:`apply_modes`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    enabled
        Master switch. Defaults to :data:`False` (byte-identical).
    fail_closed_threshold
        When ``fused >= fail_closed_threshold`` the decision layer fail-closes the
        attempt (replacing ``GraspingDecisionConfig.auto_uncertainty_threshold``).
        Default ``0.4`` mirrors the legacy value.
    apply_modes
        Stable mode names the layer applies to. ``"easy"`` is rejected.
    weights
        Per-channel non-negative weights. When :attr:`enabled` at least one weight
        must be strictly positive (otherwise the fused signal is unconditionally
        zero, which is a footgun).
    ranking_penalty_weight
        Ranking carrier. Multiplies the fused uncertainty when subtracting from a
        candidate score. Default ``0.0`` => ranking byte-identical.
    recovery_aggressive_threshold
        Recovery carrier. When fused exceeds this threshold the orchestrator may
        prefer perception-recovery actions (``NEXT_VIEWPOINT``/``RESCAN``). Default
        ``1.01`` => never trips (fused is clamped to ``[0, 1]``).
    calibration_artifact_path
        Optional path (absolute or relative to the config root) to a JSON
        calibration artifact produced by
        :mod:`src.robot.grasping.calibration.uncertainty_calibration`.
        When :data:`None`, the identity calibration is used.

class GraspingSuccessModelConfig(StrictModel):
    """Success-probability overlay (default off).

    Ships the offline trainer + artifact + runtime-pure predictor. Defaults are
    picked so adding this block (or omitting it) is byte-identical:
    ``enabled=False`` => nothing in the pipeline loads or runs the model.

    Attributes
    ----------
    enabled
        Master switch. Defaults to :data:`False` so the model is opaque to the
        runtime.
    artifact_dir
        Path (absolute or relative to the config root) of the directory containing
        ``model.json`` and ``manifest.json``. Defaults to the committed v1 artifact
        under ``assets/models/success_probability/v1``.
    feature_schema_version
        The feature-schema version the runtime expects the artifact to declare.
        Bumping it opts future feature-set extensions out of the v1 artifact
        without breaking old deployments.
    apply_modes
        Stable mode names the model may score in. Defaults to the four canonical
        modes; ``"easy"`` is included because easy pick rate is the
        strict-improvement target the model is calibrated against.
    ranking_blend_enabled
        Master switch for the bounded probability-blend reranker. Defaults to
        :data:`False` (byte-identical). When :data:`True` (and ``enabled``, and a
        non-shadow lifecycle artifact is loaded), the runtime reranks
        ``best_result.candidates`` in dense modes only using the convex blend
        ``(1 - w) * geometric + w * predicted_p``.
    ranking_blend_weight
        Blend weight ``w``. Clamped to ``[0.0, 0.5]`` so the geometric score always
        retains >=50 % influence and a miscalibrated model cannot dominate ranking.
        Default ``0.20``.
    ranking_blend_modes
        Locked dense-only subset of grasp-modes the blend reranker may operate in:
        a subset of ``{"dense_clutter", "dense_autonomous"}`` (``"easy"`` and
        ``"auto"`` stay geometry-only so easy pick-rate cannot regress). Must also
        be a subset of ``apply_modes`` (else the shadow probability is never

    Attributes
    ----------
    enabled
        Master switch. When ``False`` the runtime still records latency telemetry
        but does not emit breach events or apply bounded-compute fallbacks. Default
        ``False`` is byte-identical.
    decision_latency_slo_ms / ranking_latency_slo_ms / fusion_latency_slo_ms
        Per-stage p95 budgets enforced by the SLO gate.
    decision_timeout_ms / ranking_timeout_ms / fusion_timeout_ms
        Hard per-stage caps. ``0.0`` means "no cap" (the current default); non-zero
        values are honoured once the producers light up, and treated as telemetry
        budgets today.
    model_fallback_policy
        How the runtime degrades when the success-probability model breaches its
        timeout: ``"legacy_score"`` reverts to geometry-only ranking, ``"skip"``
        omits the probability signal, ``"fail_closed"`` fail-closes with a typed
        reason.
    fusion_fallback_policy
        How the runtime degrades when fusion breaches its timeout: ``"skip"``
        proceeds with single-view evidence, ``"fail_closed"`` fail-closes.
    emit_breach_events
        When ``True`` and ``enabled``, the service emits a
        ``RobotWatchdogEvent.SLO_BREACH`` on rising-edge p95 breaches. Default
        ``False``.
    breach_window_size
        Rolling window length (in attempts) for the in-runtime p95 that drives
        ``SLO_BREACH`` emission. The replay/soak ``--slo-gate`` computes p95 across
        the full pack.

    **Shadow, and shadow for a measured reason.** The first ranker, fitted on aletheia's shaken
    corpus, beat the calculator by 17.7 pp on the same units and still lost to picking at random,
    because the failure it had to predict is `finger_collision` and its features could not see the
    surroundings. A version that had acted would have acted wrongly. What this logs is
    ``would_change_top1``: whether turning it on would do anything, answered on every real pick instead
    of argued about.

    Enabling it adds telemetry keys and changes NO decision. That is deliberate and it is also what the

    ``collision_checker.py`` skipped the whole check: ``rejected_table`` was 0 in 2128 of 2128
    telemetry lines while the independent reference rejected **37 %** of the same candidates for
    driving a finger under the support. This block is what fills it.

    **The height is a declared number refined by what the cameras see, and the higher of the two wins.**
    That combination is measured, not chosen. Over 1073 reference objects:

    ======================  =========================  ===========================
    estimator               on the table (n=1052)      standing on something (n=21)
    ======================  =========================  ===========================
    declared height alone   median +0.00, 0 % too low  median -14.08, **100 % too low**
    target footprint        median +1.81, 0 % too low  median +0.89, 0 % too low
    plane fit near the      median +19.97              median -1.19, 33 % too low
    object / whole scene    median +14.75              median +9.41, 33 % too low
    ======================  =========================  ===========================

    A declared height cannot know that an object is standing on another object, and there it is too low
    **every single time**. Both plane fits are worse still: they go too low on a third of the stacked
    cases, which is the direction that breaks a gripper. The target's own lowest point was never too
    low in any of the 1073 cases, so taking the higher of the two can only ever be conservative.

    **The footprint is fused across cameras**, and that is also measured. A single view of a bin sees
    the object over the wall, so its lowest visible point is the rim rather than the base: p90 error
    **50.6 mm** in the ``bin`` family, 38 % of objects more than 10 mm too high. Taking the lowest point
    over all cameras that identified the object cuts that to **13.3 mm** and 10.6 %, and stays at 0 %
    too low everywhere. What one camera cannot see behind a wall, another can.

    **Known limit, stated so it is not rediscovered.** Even fused, the footprint still reads high in a
    bin (p90 13.3 mm against 1.7 mm in the open). Since the higher value wins, that costs some valid
    low grasps in exactly the family that is already hardest. Declaring ``container.floor_height_mm``
    does not fix it: the floor is the lower of the two and the fused estimate still wins. Closing it
    needs either a fourth camera low enough to see the base, or a rule that recognises an estimate as
    wall-occluded; the second is a candidate and has not been measured, so it is not implemented.
