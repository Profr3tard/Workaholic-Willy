"""How much a config field is anyone's business: derived, never hand-maintained.

The config accepts 545 fields. Almost nobody needs almost any of them, and a listing that treats them
all alike buries the handful that matter: ``where gripper`` returns 34 hits with no hint that two are
cell facts and thirty are tuning behind a switch nobody turned on.

So each field carries a tier. Two rules bound what a tier is allowed to be:

  1. A tier is a display filter, never a gate. Every field stays settable, ``extra='forbid'`` keeps
     accepting it, and hiding it from a listing removes nothing. Dropping a value from a file removes
     nothing; dropping a field removes a capability, and a tier must never be mistaken for that.
  2. A required field is never demoted. 63 fields have no default at all, and treating one as long
     tail invites defaulting it later, which trades a hard load failure for a silent value in the
     fail-open direction.

A tier is derived from what the schema and the loaded cell already say, not declared per field: a
hand-maintained table of 545 entries drifts the moment a block's ``enabled`` flips, and would have
to be re-blessed into the schema golden. Derivation cannot drift, and costs the goldens nothing.
