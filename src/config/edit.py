"""Writing a measured value back into the config tree, without destroying the file it lands in.

Three of the numbers this stack depends on cannot be read out of anything: payload mass, the
flange-to-grasp-centre transform, and which physical camera is on which rig. A person measures them
at a bench with a scale, a caliper and ``rs-enumerate-devices``, and the cell refuses to run until
they are typed in. Putting such a measurement where the loader will find it is the whole job here.
This is not a config editor.

Only :data:`WRITABLE` may be written. Everything under ``safety.*`` beyond the payload measurement,
every workspace and motion limit and every threshold stays YAML-only: those values sit next to the
comments that carry the evidence for them ("6/6 up to 6 mm and 0/6 at 10 mm"), and a value changed
without reading its comment is a value changed without knowing what it was for. The payload and the
tool frame are measurements rather than policy, which is what makes them the exception.

Nothing here round-trips YAML. A ``safe_load``/``dump`` cycle silently deletes every comment in the
file, which in this tree is most of the knowledge, so the editor only rewrites the value on a single
existing line or inserts new lines; every other byte is copied through untouched.

After writing, the whole tree is reloaded through the real loader and the real validators. On any
failure (a typo, a cross-field validator, a rejected enum, a bug in the line editor itself) the
original file is restored and the validation error is returned, so the tree is never left in a state
the loader would refuse.
