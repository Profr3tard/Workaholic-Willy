"""Leakage audits.

Approved defaults:

1. **Hard reject** on any overlap of ``attempt_id`` between splits.
2. **Hard reject** on any overlap of ``(scene_id, camera_pose_hash)``
   when both fields are present.
3. **Soft warn at >5%, hard reject at >10%** for ``object_set``
   overlap (warns become rejects when ``strict=True``).
4. **Hard reject** when ``extra.timestamp`` ranges between train and
   test overlap by more than the median per-attempt duration.
