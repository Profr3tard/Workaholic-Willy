"""Shared honesty and provenance contract for RL artifacts.

Provides the single source of truth for the mandatory provenance stamps
attached to RL datasets, policy artifacts, evaluation reports, promotion
reports, and rollback/paired-soak artefacts.

Each artifact records three independent dimensions of provenance:

* ``reward_model`` and ``reward_interpretation`` the origin and honest
  meaning of the reward or score;
* ``dataset_provenance`` simulation versus real-record origin, dataset
  identity/hash, leakage status, and intended fitness;
* gate/verdict interpretation what a reported pass, abstain, or verdict
  does and does not establish, with an explicit degeneracy note where a
  single-action policy could otherwise appear to be a trained policy.

The shared reward-model values and dataset-provenance schema are validated
here, while artifact-specific interpretation text remains owned by each
producer.
